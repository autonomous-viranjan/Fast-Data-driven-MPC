Fast Data-driven Model Predictive Controller for an Ecological Predictive Cruise Controller (PCC) for Connected and Automated Vehicles.

An equivalent convex problem for the original non-convex problem is formulated using a data-driven Linear Model for the nonlinear system.

A High-level sampling based planner generates a reference trajectory -- considering uncertainty in V2V communication.

The aim of the PCC is safe longitudinal control while avoiding red light idling and optimizing fuel efficiency -- all this, while being computationally efficient and thus real-time applicable.
